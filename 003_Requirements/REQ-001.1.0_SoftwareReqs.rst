Software Requirements & Specs
###############################

Scope and Purpose 
******************

Since changes are thrown out late in the design during meetings, the requirements 
are given either vocally or through emails. It's hard to keep hundred of emails 
or remember what was said. 
This document will serve a reference guide to where I consolidate the various 
software design requirements because the company does not have or use a requirement 
capture tool, or an enterprise project management software, this is my method 
to keep my sanity.

**Goals & Rules**

* If there are requirements that exist in pdf, excel, word, etc.. and are on sharepoint, 
  embedded them here. 

* if the requirements are made known to me through emails or word of mouth, then 
  capture it in this notebook and classify it accordingly. Use the sphinx-needs 
  extension to group the requirements if possible.
