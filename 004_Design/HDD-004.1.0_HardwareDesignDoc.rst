Scope & Purpose
****************

Hardware product development starts with an idea and ends with a real product.

The hardware product development lifecycle describes the processes or actions 
that must be done over the course of real hardware product development. 

The hardware product development lifecycle can be divided into seven phases: 

1. Requirements or ideation→ 
#. Design→ 
#. Manufacturing→ 
#. Testing→ 
#. Distribution→ 
#. Use and maintenance→ Disposal. 

The purpose of this document is to make it easy to navigate where at Cummins,
I would find the relevant information related to the PCM hardware as I am developing
embedded system software for this new board.

The hardware requirement is captured elsewhere :ref:`PCM Tech Profile <HWReqs>`.
This current document focuses on the design aspect of the lifecycle.
